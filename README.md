This repository stores all the mission planning related information like planning files and code scripts for the FYP.

Disclaimer: As mentioned in the paper, none of the code scripts were fully tested due to limitations. Therefore, the code scripts were created with a combination of looking at other established examples and referring to the official API documentations.
